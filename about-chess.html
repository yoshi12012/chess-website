                refusal to defend his title in 1975 when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE, chess’s
                international governing body, over the match conditions.

                Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent’s king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in “check”) and there is no way to remove or defend it from attack on the next move.

                good chess strategies:

Imagine the best possible position for each of your pieces and then try to bring them there.
Make your first move with the e-pawn or d-pawn advancing two squares. In either case, you will open pathways for the pieces to get off of the back rank and into the fight for the central squares.
Material count is the most straightforward strategic concept to understand since it’s also the most concrete. If a player knows how to control more pieces than their opponent, they will have a better chance of winning.
Pawn structure is an important strategic concept in chess. The way you arrange your pawns can have a big impact on your game.
Space is related to the number of squares a player has behind their pawns where their pieces can be developed. If you have more space than your opponent, you will have more room to maneuver your pieces1.

                The longest game of chess that is theoretically possible is 5,949 moves.
                The first chessboard with alternating light and dark squares (as it appears today) was made in Europe in 1090.
                The number of unique chess games is 10^120.
                Chess first appeared in India about the 6th century AD and by the 10th century had spread from Asia to the Middle East and Europe1.

                The shortest game of chess ever played is called the “Fool’s Mate” and it can be completed in just two moves. It involves moving the pawn in front of the king two spaces forward and then moving the bishop out to attack the opponent’s f7 square.
